"""Seasonal adjustment.

Robustly estimate trend and periodicity in a timeseries.

`Seasonal` can recover additive periodic variation from noisy
timeseries data with only a few periods.  It is intended for
estimating seasonal effects when initializing structural timeseries
models like Holt-Winters. Input samples are assumed evenly-spaced from
a continuous-time signal with noise (white or impulsive) but no
longer-term structural anomalies like level shifts.

The seasonal estimate will be a list of period-over-period averages at
each seasonal offset. You may specify a period length, or have it
estimated from the data. The latter is an interesting capability of
this package.

    """Estimate seasonal effects in a series.

    Estimate the major period of the data by testing seasonal
    differences for various period lengths and returning the seasonal
    offsets that best predict out-of-sample variation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Series data. assumes at least 2 periods of data are provided.
    trend : ndarray or string ("median", "spline", "line" or None)
        If ndarray, remove this trend series prior to fitting seasons.
        If string, fit a trend of named type (see fit_trend() for details)
    period : integer or None
        Use the specified period (number of samples), or estimate if None.
        Note that if a specified period does not yield a seasonal effect that
        is better than no seasonal adjustment, None will be returned.
    min_ev : 0..1
        Minimum variance explained by seasonal adjustment.
        reject a seasonal effect if the expected explained variance of the
        specified or estimated period is less than this.
    periodogram_thresh : float (0..1) or None
        As a speedup, restrict attention to a range of periods
        derived from the input signal's periodogram (see periodogram_peaks()).
        If None, test all periods.

    Returns
    -------
    seasons, trend : ndarray or None, ndarray
        seasons: estimated seasonal factor array, or None if no
        periodicity is detected. The array length is the period.
        trend: fitted (or supplied) trend prior to seasonal fit.

    Notes
    -----
    Two steps:

    First, a range of likely periods is estimated via periodogram
    averaging [2]_.  This is an optional, ad-hoc optimization, and
    though it works well for all our tests and examples there are
    surely classes of signal that will fool it.

    Next, a time-domain period estimator chooses the best integer
    period based on cross-validated residual errors [1]_. It also
    tests the strength of the seasonal effect using the R^2 of the
    leave-one-out cross-validation. For the seasonal model used here,
    this is the expected fraction of variance explained by the best
    seasonal estimate.
