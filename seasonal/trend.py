"""Trend estimation for timeseries.

Estimate and remove trend in a timeseries.

In this package, trend removal is in service of isolating and
estimating periodic (non-trend) variation. "trend" is in the sense of
Cleveland's STL decomposition -- a lowpass smoothing of
the data that, when removed from the original series, preserves
original seasonal variation.  Detrending is accomplishd by a coarse
fitted spline, mean or median filters, or a fitted line.

Input samples are assumed evenly-spaced from an anomaly-free
continuous-time signal.
